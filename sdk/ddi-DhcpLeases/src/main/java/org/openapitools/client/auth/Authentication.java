/*
 * DHCP Leases API
 * The DHCP Leases application is a BloxOne DDI service that stores information about leases. It is part of the full-featured, DDI cloud solution that enables customers to deploy large numbers of protocol servers to deliver DNS and DHCP throughout their enterprise network. Hosts are authoritative for their lease data. Changes to leases are periodically replicated to the cloud and stored by this service for display purposes. There is no lease history, so only current leases are available. In other words, every _dhcp/lease_ for that matter, represents a lease that is currently active. Note that fixed addresses do not have leases.
